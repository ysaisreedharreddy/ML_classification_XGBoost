XGBoost Classifier for Customer Churn Prediction
Welcome to my repository where I demonstrate the use of the XGBoost algorithm for predicting customer churn based on financial services data. This project covers data preprocessing, model building, evaluation, and enhancement techniques such as cross-validation.

Project Description
In this project, the XGBoost classifier is applied to the "Churn_Modelling" dataset to predict whether bank customers will leave the bank within six months. The dataset includes details such as customer's credit score, geography, gender, age, tenure, balance, and number of products used at the bank.

Features
Data Preprocessing: Includes handling categorical variables with encoding techniques and feature scaling for optimal performance.
Model Building: Utilizes the powerful XGBoost classifier with hyperparameter tuning.
Model Evaluation: Uses a confusion matrix and accuracy score to evaluate model performance.
Cross-Validation: Implements k-fold cross-validation to ensure the model's robustness.

Technologies Used
Python
Pandas, Numpy - for data manipulation
Matplotlib - for data visualization
Scikit-learn - for model building and evaluation
XGBoost - for the prediction model

Model Insights
The project successfully demonstrates the ability of XGBoost to handle imbalanced data and predict outcomes with high accuracy. The findings and techniques used here can be adapted for similar prediction tasks requiring robust and efficient solutions.
